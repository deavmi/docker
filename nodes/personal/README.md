## Environment variables

### Quassel

For your **first run** ensure that within the `.quassel`
environment file (which you will have to create) you
do not have `QUASSEL_CFG_ENV` set.

Then connect to your Quassel core and go through the
setup wizard.

Once done, then go and set `QUASSEL_CFG_ENV` to anything
that you want and this will disable the setup wizard.
